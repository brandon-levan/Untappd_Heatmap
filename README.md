# Untappd_Heatmap

Visualizing my Untappd check-ins through a Folium interactive heap map and create an embeddable link by deploying the map as a Heroku web application.

About
This is the official github repository, for the articles, Making Cool Maps with Geopy and Folium and Your Cool Folium Maps on the Web published in TOWARDS DATA SCIENCE, created to share how to create an interactive map, visualizing African cities with Geopy and Folium, and how to finally deploy it to the web.

Interactive map
The interactive map was created with the folium package in python with the help of geopy. Interactive maps are a way to present data at particular geographic locations in an aesthetically pleasing way.

Deploying to the web
The map was deployed to the web with heroku. Here, you can see the steps taken to get this done.
